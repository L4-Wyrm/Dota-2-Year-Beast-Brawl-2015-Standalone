title: Year Beast Brawl Standalone
descript: [i]Most of Dota 2 Players (especially who play it), remember Year Beast Brawl 2015 event by Valve, where you play standart All Pick, but also with Year Beast (aka Nian).  Well this custom gamemode similar to original Valve event, but  there a bit little differences. That can be seen below.[/i]
